## Milestone Tracking

Completed: v0.1 → v1.0 (foundation through distributed systems and AI integration). UI/UX and performance optimization remain in-progress items targeting v1.1+.

## Performance Metrics (summary)

- Allocation speed: 8.2 ns/op
- Context switch: 45 ns
- Discovery time: 12 ms

## Roadmap v1.1 → v2.0 (summary)

Short term: critical bug fixes, boot time <1s, improved tooling (IDE plugins). Medium term: enterprise readiness and cloud integration. Long term: marketplace and governance features.

## Risks & Mitigation

- Hardware fragmentation: universal HAL and reference BSPs
- Security: hardware acceleration and staged audits
- Vendor drivers: outreach and partnership templates
